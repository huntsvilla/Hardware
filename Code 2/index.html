<h2>Input Device</h2>

<p>Input Devices give information for the computer to process. An example of popular input device would be a plugging in a keyboard and having your computer process its data.</p>

<a name="outputdevice"></a>
<h2>Output Device</h2>

<p>Similar to an Input devices an output device doesnt give information it recieves it. For example from a compter you can give data to your printer you have connected, telling the printer what to print.</p>


<a name="cpu"></a>
<h2>Computer Processing Unit</h2>

<p>The CPU is in otherwords the brain of the computer. The CPU has the important job of processing information you give the computer.</p>

<a name="arithemeticlogicunit"></a>
<h2>Arithmetic logic unit</h2>

<p>The ALU performes arithemetic operations for your computer. It also acted as a base design for the Central processing unit</p>

<a name="controlunit"></a>
<h2>Control Unit</h2>

<p>The CU is a very important component of the CPU thats in charge of directing the operations of the processors.</p>

<a name="ram"></a>
<h2>Random Access Memory</h2>

<p>Random access memory also known as RAM is a form of memory used to store active data like code or games. RAM is important because it can be read or changed however.</p>
<a name="optical memory"></a>
<h2>Optical Memory</h2>

<p>Optical memory is like RAM but instead of being stored on your computer its stored on a DVD or disc of some sort. RAM is easier and faster to usen so I havent really used Optical memory that much.</p>

<a name="magneticmemory"></a>
<h2>Magnetic Memory</h2>

<p>Magnetic memory is an early form of RAM. An early form of Magetic energy would be a floppy disk. Today you can see magnetic storage on credit cards.</p>

<a name="flashmemory"></a>
<h2>Flash Memory</h2>

<p>Flash memory does not need any power to store data. A USB drive is a type of flash memory that we use often today.</p>

<a name="logicgate"></a>
<h2>Logic Gate</h2>

<p>Logic Gates are are a key building block of intergrated circuits. Their job is to perform basic functions.</p>
